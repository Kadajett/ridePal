You need npm, grunt, and bower to run this project.

Clone the git repository, then run 'npm install', 'bower install', 'grunt serve';

open up a web browser and navigate to localhost:9000

You are done.

Flow of the application:

- create a new point with description, lat and long
- add as many of these points to the route you are creating as you would like.
- add a description to your route. This acts as the title also
- Save your route to the 'server(Which doesn't exist. Made the mistake of spending to much time on the client side first)'
- from there, you can view the route points on the map, there is a click callback function available, but it does nothing as of right now. 
- You can also delete routes. with the ugly big red buttons.

## there was definitely a lot to do in such a small ammount of time. Thank you for the opportunity, and the challenge.
